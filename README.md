Analyzing Digi Key Product Manufacturer and Product Details Data Interpretation &amp;  Business Recommendations
Digi-Key Product and Manufacturer Data Analysis

Project Overview

This SQL project analyzes a comprehensive dataset containing Digi-Key product details and manufacturer information. It aims to extract actionable insights on product pricing, inventory health, revenue generation, and supply chain performance. Using SQL, we explore product manufacturing trends, identify high-performing manufacturers, and provide data-driven recommendations for business strategy.

Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following columns:
product_url, category_url, part_number, description, manufacturer, manufacturer_url, datasheet_url, rohs_compliant, stock, price, product_category, manufacture_part_number, digikey_part_number, lead_time, input_link, ratings, series, package, operating_temperature, features, mounting_type, package_case, supplier_device_package, type, image, documents_and_media, url, pricing_per_quantity, moisture_sensitivity_level_msl, eccn, htsus, additional_resources, other_names, marketplace_product, standard_package, mfr_standard_lead_time, alternate_packaging, categories, stock_numeric, stock_numeric2, date_added, combined_stock.

Main Analyses and Queries:

	1.High-Value Manufacturers: Identifying manufacturers with products priced higher than category averages.
	2.Stockout Risk: Highlighting high-risk products with low stock levels and long lead times.
	3.Lead Time Analysis: Analyzing manufacturers with above-average lead times and ranking them.
	4.Feature Prevalence: Identifying the most common product features in each category.
	5.Profitability Analysis: Finding the least and most profitable categories and manufacturers.
	6.Pricing and Inventory Trends: Determining the most expensive products, category-wise price averages, and inventory health (overstocked, understocked).
	7.Revenue Insights: Analyzing total revenue, average pricing, and stock across manufacturers and categories.
	8.Competitive Pricing Analysis: Comparing similarly priced products within categories to identify bundling and pricing strategies.

 Advanced Queries:
 
	•Product Pricing by Series and Manufacturer: Identifying premium series and manufacturers.
	•Top Manufacturers by Product Category: Ranking manufacturers based on product offerings in each category.
	•Revenue Impact by Product and Category: Calculating contributions to total revenue for targeted investments.

Business Recommendations:

	•Strengthen partnerships with high-performing manufacturers such as ABLIC Inc. and YAGEO.
	•Implement predictive inventory strategies to prevent stockouts for critical items.
	•Negotiate lead times with underperforming suppliers to improve supply chain efficiency.
	•Focus marketing on premium products and high-value categories for better profitability.
	•Develop bundling strategies for closely priced products to attract cost-sensitive customers.

 Conclusion:
 
This project demonstrates the use of SQL for extracting actionable insights from a complex dataset. The analyses provide guidance for improving supply chain resilience, inventory management, and financial performance while highlighting opportunities in pricing and market positioning.
